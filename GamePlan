#Steps
#0. Look for Menufile
#1. Get path/to/files
#2. Identify what type of project it is
#3. Check for and install if need be Load Balancer, Databases and Web Servers
#4. Save settings in Private File
#5. Setup Daemon
#6. Append to Load Balancer
#7. Restart Load Balancer

#What needs to be in the Menufile
#Domain Name
#App Name (If you don't want it to be your folder name)
#Special Database settings that might be different than your own
#Mode: Production,Development,Test or Other
#Other Installations like ImageMagick or Memecached

#Features
# Supports Rails, Sinatra and other Rack based web apps
# Supports NodeJS based web apps
# A Git daemon? (Need to research how to setup remote repo)
# Installation and one command on DigitalOcean or whatever server
# Then you just need to use git to push to it like Dokku. The difference that
# 1. you don't need to conform to Dokku (Custom Technology and Custom Settings)
# 2. the git push it optional
# 3. The code is available for you to inspect. Completely Transparent
