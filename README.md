# Tuesday.rb
## Fast Casual DigitalOcean Ruby Deployment


Tuesday is a deployment service that makes deploying Ruby apps to DigitalOcean quick, simple, and with straight-forward minimalist configuration. Tuesday works with Rails and other Rack-based apps, and automatically configures itself to your stack. Make your production work for your deployment, not the other way around. And for dessert, enjoy simple subdomain configuration with equally simple ease.

Tuesday was developed during HackNY Fall 2014, and is in continual development. Bug reports are loved, and use is ultimately at your own risk!

```$ gem install tuesday```

```$ cd your_awesome_project``` 

```$ echo domain: 'your.domain' >> Menufile``` 

```$ tuesday ```
