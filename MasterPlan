#Tuesday Master Plan

I want tuesday be a serious alternative to dokku/heroku

Rather than forcing my application to configure to dokku/heroku, I want it to figure out what I have been building

Will there be a limitation on this? Probably but if it is more flexible than dokku/heroku than I feel it has been a success

I want to have two line installations

$ git clone/git pull
$ tuesday

when on deploy server

However, it could be fun to borrow from Dokku and Heroku
$ git push tuesday
when on development but that will come later

Will need to research how to setup remote gitrepos and how you can communicate to and from
haha Call it Takeout

The difference is that my application is here to help you get set up not provide a platform

Ultimately it should allow an user to use any of the supported databases, allow cross application database communication
easy subdomains and git push deployment

Will Support
  Apps: Sinatra, Rails, Any Rack?
  Databases: MongoDB, Postgresql, MySQL, Redis, SQLite
  Webservers: Puma, Unicorn, Passanger
  ORMS: ActiveRecord, Mongo-Mapper, Mongoid, Data-mapper
  Rubys: RubyMRI, JRuby, Rubinus (Not sure if we need to do anything for that....RVM should do that?)

Question is do we default to Production or Development?
Oh :D if Production is filled with bullshit Heroku/Dokku nonsense we just use the default settings
